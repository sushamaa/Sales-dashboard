## [Streamlit app](https://performance-dashboard.streamlit.app/)

This project is a sales dashboard created using Streamlit. On the left side, you'll find various interactive components, called 'sliders,' that allow us to filter and customize the data we're viewing. These sliders could include options for selecting specific modes, periods, routes, or regions. Just so you know, changing the mode will result in modifications to the entire report.
In the main section of the dashboard, we have visual representations of our sales data in the form of tables and graphs. These elements provide an overview of our sales performance, making it easy to identify trends and insights. The tables may display detailed sales figures, while the graphs visually represent data points, which can help us grasp patterns more intuitively.
Feel free to explore the dashboard by adjusting the sliders and interacting with the different elements to gain a deeper understanding of sales performance.
